# Docker 101 self-paced labs

There are three parts this lab

* [Part 1](./part1.md) deals with basic container management
* Part 2 covers the Docker file system and Docker volumes (including persistent data)
* Part 3 talks about orchestration with Swarm and how Docker handles networking

There is also a PDF of the slides I use when I present this as a workshop.
