# Docker 101 self-paced labs

There are three parts this lab

* [Part 1](https://github.com/mikegcoleman/docker101-linux/tree/master/part-1) deals with basic container management
* [Part 2](https://github.com/mikegcoleman/docker101-linux/tree/master/part-2) covers the Docker file system and Docker volumes (including persistent data)
* [Part 3](https://github.com/mikegcoleman/docker101-linux/tree/master/part-3) talks about orchestration with Swarm and how Docker handles networking

There is also a PDF of the slides I use when I present this as a workshop.
